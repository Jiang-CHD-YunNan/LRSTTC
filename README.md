# LRSTTC: Optical Remote Sensing Landslide Dataset along the Sichuan–Tibet Transportation Corridor

## Introduction

Automatic, efficient, and reliable landslide datasets are critically important for landslide recognition, early warning, risk assessment, and post-disaster recovery. To address this strong demand, we constructed an **optical remote sensing landslide dataset along the Sichuan–Tibet Transportation Corridor**, referred to as the **LRSTTC dataset**.

This dataset significantly reduces the time and effort required for sample collection and manual data annotation, thereby facilitating related research in landslide detection and analysis. Considering the limited professional level of the authors, if any errors or issues are found in the dataset, please feel free to contact us for corrections and improvements at:

## Dataset Construction

The LRSTTC dataset was constructed based on high-resolution optical remote sensing images acquired along the Sichuan–Tibet Transportation Corridor. According to the **time of occurrence** and the **spectral and textural characteristics** of landslides observed in the images, the dataset can be roughly divided into two categories:

- **New Landslides**
- **Old Landslides**

### 1. New Landslides

New landslides are those that occurred recently. Their typical characteristics include:

- Clearly visible **main scarp, landslide body, and toe**
- A distinct sliding surface
- Obvious color differences between the landslide area and surrounding features

These features make new landslides relatively easy to identify in optical remote sensing images.

### 2. Old Landslides

Old landslides occurred earlier and exhibit more complex visual characteristics:

- The color of the landslide body is often similar to surrounding features
- Vegetation may have grown on parts of the landslide
- Despite these changes, the **overall landslide shape**, **back wall**, and **front deposits** can still be observed
- In some cases, **man-made buildings** are located on or above landslide accumulations, posing significant potential hazards

(a) (30°58′16″N, 101°09′19″E) represents a **new landslide**, and  
(b) (30°12′09″N, 99°56′10″E) represents an **old landslide**.  
Images a1, a2, and b1 were obtained from **Google Earth**, while a3 and b2 were obtained from **on-site surveys**.
