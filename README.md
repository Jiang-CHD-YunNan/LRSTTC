# LRSTTC
Given that automatic, efficient, and reliable landslide datasets have a strong need for landslide recognition, early warning, risk assessment, and post-disaster recovery, we have created an optical remote sensing image landslide dataset along the Sichuan-Tibet Transportation Corridor (LRSTTC dataset), which significantly reduces the time and energy of sample collection and data labeling for related researchers.
Considering the limited professional level of the author, if there are errors in the dataset, please contact us for changes and improvements.（2020126041@chd.edu.cn）
